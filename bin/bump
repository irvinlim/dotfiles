# Usage:
#
# Bump the version as specified in the `version` file found in the current directory:
#   $ bump
#
# Bump a different version file:
#   $ bump src/VERSION
#
# For more complicated use cases, use the bumpversion command instead, as this only serves
# to be a simple alias for patch bumps + commits.
